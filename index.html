			<p class="justify"> Welcome to Prairie Acupuncture! I am Ellen Emanuel, Lincoln, NE licensed Acupuncturist. As a private practitioner of Asian Medicine, my dedication to patients comes through with individual assessment and treatment plans.  Focusing on both physical and emotional aliments, I recognizing the body as a whole.  With each customizd treatment I aim to bring the body back into balance, to facilitate healing.  My experience  in treating patients ranges from autoimmune, womens health, psychological disorders to musculoskeletal.  I have a passion for treating Veternas, and worked in Manhattan's VA Hosiptal where the primary focus was treating PTSD.   I also worked in Manhattans IWD (Initiative for Women with Disabilties) where I treated women with chronic, degenerative diseases such as Lupus, MS, Fibromyalgia and Post-Polio Syndrome.</p>

				<p class="justify">Chinese Medicine practitioners look at you as a whole, not just one disease or ailment. The initial treatment will take longer, usually 90 minutes. This allows the practitioner ample time to do a thorough health history and asses where the problem lies. Your practitioner will then begin treatment.</p>

				<p class="justify">How you can prepare for treatment:</p>
				<ul class="left">
					<li>Eat at least two hours prior to treatment.</li>
					<li>Bring a list of current medications, including prescriptions, over the counter, vitamins and herbal supplements.</li>
					<li>Wear loose fitting clothing. Wearing clothing that is comfortable and can be rolled up is appropriate.</li>
				</ul>

				<p><em>Friendly Reminder: </em>Treatments will not be performed on individuals who are intoxicated.</p>

				<p class="justify">After your initial consulation and treatment plan has been set, you will continue your plan with 1 or more follow-up treatment session. Techniques such as traditional Acupuncture, Cupping, or Moxabustion (Moxa) will be used to help with your specific ailment. Most people find treatments to be very relaxing and may fall asleep during  treatment. Again, Ellen will come up with a treatment plan to fit your individual needs.</p>

			<h4>Location</h4>
			<p>We are located at:</p>
			<a href="https://www.google.com/maps/place/4747+Pioneers+Blvd+%23700,+Lincoln,+NE+68506">
				<p>
					4747 Pioneers Blvd Suite 700 H<br>
					Lincoln, NE 68506
				</p>
			</a>

			<p class="justify">We are located on the southwest corner of first and main street in the such and such office building. We are located on the 2nd floor in suite h. There is plenty of parking or you can get to us by taking the #43 bus.</p>

			<p class="justify">If you enter the building from the main parking lot, you can take the elevator to your right up to the 2nd floor and turn right. We are the 2nd door on the left. You can also take the stairs from the main entrance; once you're on the 2nd floor we're the 3rd door on the left.</p>

			<p class="justify">If you enter the building from the first ave entrance, you can take the elevator blah blah blah blah</p>

			<!-- <dl class="option">
				<dt><em>Option 1:</em></dt>
				<dd>We <em>highly</em> recommend this option! You can get roundtrip door-to-door service through <a href="http://coloradomountainexpress.hudsonltd.net/res?USERIDENTRY=FLSC15&LOGON=GO">Colorado Mountain Express</a> to and from either of the two airports mentioned directly to The Christie Lodge.</dd>

				<dd>Again, we recommend this option as this company is trained to drive in the extreme winter conditions in the mountains. It will save you the headache of having to drive and will get you to our wedding reliably. Once you arrive at The Christie Lodge, you really don't need private transportation to get around Avon, Beaver Creek, or Vail.</dd>

				<dt><em>Option 2:</em></dt>
				<dd>If you would like to rent a vehicle, both Denver International and Eagle County offer vehicle rental services. It is about a 2&frac12; hour drive from Denver International Airport, and about a 30 minute drive from Eagle County Airport (depending on the weather).</dd>
				<dd><a href="#">Directions from Denver International Airport: </a></dd>
				<dd class="justify">Follow the main road out of the airport. Join I-70 west towards “Grand Junction”. Follow I-70 west for approximately 110-120 miles to exit 167, “AVON”. Get off at exit 167 – Make a left turn (third exit) at the third main roundabout south of I-70, the one with the 4 large galloping horse sculptures in the center, and The Christie Lodge is on your left. </dd>
