			<p class="justify"> Welcome to Prairie Acupuncture! I am Ellen Emanuel, Lincoln, NE licensed Acupuncturist. As a private practitioner of Asian Medicine, my dedication to patients comes through with individual assessment and treatment plans.  Focusing on both physical and emotional aliments, I recognizing the body as a whole.  With each customizd treatment I aim to bring the body back into balance, to facilitate healing.  My experience  in treating patients ranges from autoimmune, womens health, psychological disorders to musculoskeletal.  I have a passion for treating Veternas, and worked in Manhattan's VA Hosiptal where the primary focus was treating PTSD.   I also worked in Manhattans IWD (Initiative for Women with Disabilties) where I treated women with chronic, degenerative diseases such as Lupus, MS, Fibromyalgia and Post-Polio Syndrome.</p>

				<p class="justify">Chinese Medicine practitioners look at you as a whole, not just one disease or ailment. Your first appointment will take longer than a normal session, usually 90 minutes. This allows the practitioner ample time to complete a thorough health history and asses where the problem lies. Your practitioner will work with you to determine a treatment plan that is best for you and will then most likely begin treatment.</p>
				<p class="justify">How you can prepare for your first appointment:</p>
				<ul class="left">
					<li>Eat at least two hours prior to treatment.</li>
					<li>Bring a list of current medications, including prescriptions, over the counter, vitamins and herbal supplements.</li>
					<li>Wear loose fitting clothing. Wearing clothing that is comfortable and can be rolled up is appropriate.</li>

			<h4>Acupuncture</h4>

				<p class="justify"> Acupuncture is one of the primary modalities used in Chinese Medicine that originated over 3,000 years ago. Acupuncture is the gentle insertion of very fine, sterilized needles into specific points along meridian systems in the body. The insertion stimulates the movement of Qi (pronounced "chee") which facilitates the body's natural healing ability. Each of the meridians connects to one specific organ, or group of organs, that control bodily functions. Illness and disease result when Qi is blocked or stagnates, or when the body has too much, or too little of it. Acupuncture allows Qi to flow freely, restoring wellbeing. Acupuncure needles activate nerve responses which in turn release endorphins. The stimulation of acupuncure needles stimulate sensory receptors, which consecutively have the ability to alter biochemical and physiological conditions. 

				<p class="justify">Acupuncture is different for everybody. Some people feel tingling, numbness, warmth or heaviness, while others feel nothing.  Most people find acupuncture very relaxing and many fall asleep during treatment. Acupuncture needles are extremely thin, thus causing little to no pain. Needles stay in anywhere between 15-40 minutes. After the acupunctrist quickly removes the needles, patients often describe feeling very relaxed and renergjzed. Depending on the condition, patients can feel relief immediately or a few days later. Chronic conditions can take longer to resolve than acute. Your acupuncturist will come up with a treatment plan to fit your individual needs.</p>

				<h6 class="left">Additional Practices:</h6>


				<dl>
					<dt><em>Cupping:</em></dt>
					<dd>Cupping is a technique that involves placing jars on the skin, creating a vacuum seal and suctioning out the air. The underlying tissue is raised into the cup. Cupping increases circulation, pulls toxins from tissues, releases "heat", and relieves pain.</dd>

					<dt><em>Moxabustion (Moxa):</em></dt>
					<dd>Moxa is used frequently in Chinese Medicine. It is the practice of burning an herb called Mugwort near an acupuncture point. Moxa opens the channels, relieves pain, enhances circulation, removes "cold" from the channels, and regulates Qi and blood flow.</dd>

					<dt><em>Eastern Nutrition:</em></dt>
					<dd>Chinese Medicine takes the approach that food is health. Supporting your health and wellbeing through a diet that utilities the healing properties of food. Eating seasonally and constitutionally is the basis for Eastern Nutrition. With the foundation of the five elements, the practitioner will base foods around your current health concerns.</dd>

				<p>&#8220;On Mother's Day of 2014, I lost sense of taste and movement to the left side of my face. I was diagnosed with Bell's Palsy in the ER and given Prednisone. I was told I may or may not get back full facial movement for 2-6 months. The steroids did not work at all. However, after 5 weeks of acupuncture, I gained back the ability to raise my eyebrow, smile and move my nose. Now I have my smile back. Thanks Ellen!&#8221;</p>

				<p>&#8220;I have been having acupuncture for over 20 years to deal with a painful, chronic condition. I have been treated in several cities, including New York City, and Los Angeles, but I have never had more effective treatment than when I was treated by Ellen Emanuel. She was head and shoulders above the rest, which is why I am so sad that she has moved to Nebraska. I have a complex range of entrenched neuromuscular issues, and I have not found much that helps me aside from the rare acupuncturist who gets it right. That acupuncturist was Ellen.&#8221;</p>

				<p>&#8220;Ellen's creative, empathic approach gave me genuine relief on a regular basis. I have to admit that I may not have been easy to treat, but she really listened to me, and my sense of my own body, and incorporated it into her treatment plan. She was patient, reassuring, and personally invested in my well-being. I wish she had stayed in NYC, because I doubt I will find an acupuncturist with her healing skills. Ellen's great knowledge of all treatment modalities and her charming personality put me at ease, and her treatments truly worked - what more can you ask? The people of Lincoln, Nebraska are very fortunate to have her.&#8221;</p>
